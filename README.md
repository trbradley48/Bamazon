## About

Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront that uses a database to keep track of products, prices and stock. Customers can view products and associated information about that product, or purchase products. Managers can view products, low inventory products, add quantity for a specific product or add an entirly new product to the store.

Bamazon uses an interactive prompt that will guide the customer or manager to complete their task.
